# Unsupervised-Learning

## Challenge: Crypto Clustering
### In this Challenge, I combined my financial Python programming skills with the new unsupervised learning skills that I acquired in this module.



### The steps for this challenge are broken out into the following sections:

#### 1. Import the Cryptocurrency Data 
#### 2. Prepare the Data 
#### 3. Find the Best Value for k Using the Original Data
#### 4. Cluster Cryptocurrencies with K-means Using the Original Data
#### 5. Optimize Clusters with Principal Component Analysis
#### 6. Find the Best Value for k Using the PCA Data
#### 7. Cluster the Cryptocurrencies with K-means Using the PCA Data
#### 8. Visualize and Compare the Results
