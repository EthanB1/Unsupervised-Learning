# Unsupervised-Learning

## Challenge: Crypto Clustering
### In this Challenge, I combined my financial Python programming skills with the new unsupervised learning skills that I acquired in this module.



### The steps for this challenge are broken out into the following sections:

### Import the Cryptocurrency Data 
### Prepare the Data 
### Find the Best Value for k Using the Original Data
### Cluster Cryptocurrencies with K-means Using the Original Data
### Optimize Clusters with Principal Component Analysis
### Find the Best Value for k Using the PCA Data
### Cluster the Cryptocurrencies with K-means Using the PCA Data
### Visualize and Compare the Results
